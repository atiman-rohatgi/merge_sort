#project merge_sort

objective: in this project, I have tried to replicate the merge_sort mechanism using prolog. 

functionality

          -this program is impementing the merge sorting algorithm, using the prolog language.

          -there are three steps to merge sort, dividing the unsorted list, then recusrsively sorting each half and finally merging the sorted halves and further sort them.

language: prolog
